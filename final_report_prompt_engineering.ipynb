    "This paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering, focusing on developing language features suited for a post-LLM environment. We propose new programming constructs, including Higher Order Types and Functions, Contracts, and Semantic Pattern Matching, alongside the innovative concept of 'Natural Language Types' to bridge structured software needs with the fuzziness typical of LLMs. Our approach emphasizes a bottom-up design philosophy, enhancing traditional programming patterns with AI capabilities to address both the abstractness and computational demands of integrating LLMs. This research contributes to the understanding and evolution of programming abstractions in LLM-enhanced environments, aiming to make LLMs more accessible and functional for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted software engineering, often heralded as a revolutionary force in how software engineers develop, test, and deploy code. The influence of LLMs primarily extends to two areas: firstly, the development and generation of executable code[1][2], and secondly, integrating LLM calls into other software systems' logic. In the latter case, developers either manually manipulate strings based on prompt templates and directly use foundation model APIs, or they utilize popular frameworks to meet their LLM requirements. The diversity in LLM programming abstractions has spurred active research. For example, the recently proposed Language Model System Interface Model (LMSI)[3] stratifies these abstractions into seven layers of increasing abstractness. Researchers have identified five families of LLM abstractions emerging within popular frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, many frameworks emphasize the machine learning aspects of LLMs, focusing on novel prompting techniques[4], pipeline designs[5], and efficient inference[6]. We argue that in scenarios where LLMs are *progressively* integrated into existing systems, a bottom-up approach should be adopted. This approach should prioritize programming concerns and patterns, using LLMs to enhance these patterns with powerful generalization and computational analysis capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers typically interact with LLMs at the programming language level. Similar to paradigms like Object-Oriented Programming[7], Async-Await programming[8], and Object-Relational Mappers[9], language features have enabled developers to express business logic more abstractly. The compiler then 'desugars' these constructs into a lower-level implementation that can be complex. In this project, we explore designing such language features in a post-LLM environment to understand the challenges and opportunities they present.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have chosen to augment Marvin[10], a popular LLM framework that aligns with our philosophy of empowering developers focused on using AI rather than building it. Marvin introduces several coding constructs for data transformation, entity extraction, classification, and AI functions, which serve as a foundation for our designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose and implement a set of language features enhanced by LLMs, providing an open-source implementation under the Apache license. These features include Higher Order Types and Functions, Contracts, and Semantic Pattern Matching. Second, we introduce a novel concept of 'Natural Language Types', blending structured software needs with the fuzziness typical of LLMs. Lastly, we outline a novel type-driven and unit-tests-driven code generation methodology that, while not yet implemented, lays the groundwork for future developments.\n",

    "## Natural Language Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, a type serves two crucial interrelated functions. First, it defines the schema of a data model by specifying the required information an object of that type should hold and setting constraints on the nature or \"type\" of each piece of data. These constraints are checked either statically or dynamically, ensuring that when a program interacts with an object of a given type, it can appropriately access and manipulate its fields. Second, in object-oriented environments, the conceptualization of types mirrors the natural language reasoning about physical objects. This intuitive alignment between programming types and natural language facilitates understanding, particularly beneficial when working with LLMs trained on human language data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of Natural Language Types is straightforward yet innovative, primarily consisting of two elements. Traditional data types like int and string often fall short in describing complex, fuzzy constraints prevalent in natural language environments. Moreover, traditional typing systems struggle to address the interdependencies between different fields. Thus, the first component of Natural Language Types involves defining constraints at both the field level and between fields using natural language. This feature is vital as it underpins the Natural Language contract system discussed later in this work.\n",

For example, when integrating external APIs, different endpoints may necessitate different pre-processing or post-processing of data. Passing functions tailored to each API endpoint can abstract and streamline the integration process.\n",

    "### Natural Language Contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "Design by Contract (DbC)[14] is a programming methodology that defines precise interface specifications through preconditions, postconditions, and invariants, which clarify the expected behavior of software components. DbC offers significant benefits during development by reducing bugs and enhancing code reliability, as it enforces a formal agreement on what software components must accomplish before and after execution. However, implementing DbC presents challenges, particularly because business logic is often articulated in natural language, which can be ambiguous and difficult to translate into programmatically enforceable contracts. This discrepancy can lead to complexities in defining exhaustive and accurate contracts that fully encapsulate the intended behavior of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with the advent of LMs, the issues introduced by the gap between natural language business logic, and programmatically enforceable contract can be mitigated significantly, since the LMs essentially provide a way of making *documentation* executable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal use case for these flavour of contracts is not to apply them in a production environment, but rather at development and integration/testing time. The contracts make sure that the flow of values in and out of different components of the program adheres to some natural language descriptions. Whilst such checks in production would likely be intractable, it could serve as important tools to discover discrepancies between design specification and actual implementation during testing (such behavior is more commonly known in developer lingo as \"bugs\") "

    "### Semantic Pattern Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "The final programming pattern we introduce is based on Pattern Matching in programming languages, a feature that allows developers to check a value against a pattern and, if it matches, to deconstruct the value according to the structure of the pattern. This capability is typically used to simplify code that involves multiple conditions or branches, such as in switch statements or complex conditional expressions. However, traditional pattern matching is primarily structural, limited to matching and decomposing data based on predefined patterns that closely align with the data's physical structure. This structural approach restricts its applicability in scenarios where the data's context or semantics might provide a more intuitive understanding. Significantly, traditional pattern matching does not accommodate natural language-based decomposition, which could allow for a more flexible and semantic interpretation of data objects, leveraging the nuances of human language to enhance the match and decomposition processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing this limitation, we introduce a notion of *Semantic Pattern Matching* that is operated at the levels of Natural Language, incorporating fuzziness that were previously unattainable by traditional techniques. Currently, we are introducing this language construct as a standalong `match` function. However, as future work, we wish to augment the python `match` function to admit our semantic pattern matching paradigms.  "

    "## Limitations and Threats to Validity\n",
    "\n",
    "At the design level, the concepts introduced have been implemented within Python and Marvin, subjecting us to the constraints of both systems. Introducing a programming language feature without the ability to modify the underlying language requires us to manipulate existing language features to accommodate new needs, often leading to excessive code \"scaffolding\" instead of a more natural expression of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the evaluation level, a potential criticism we anticipate is the absence of an evaluation section. Unlike a prompting technique whose effectiveness can be assessed using an existing dataset with controlled variables, language design in programming is fundamentally a human-oriented endeavor. We recognize that the absence of a user study may compromise the validity of this project. Ideally, we would like to determine whether these features truly make LMs more accessible to developers. While many language features could technically be implemented more straightforwardly by \"desugaring\" them, developers often prefer them for their convenience. Without a user study, the actual impact of these language features remains uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the limitations section, for future work, we aim to conduct a user-oriented study on the practicality of these constructs, which would enhance our understanding of how software engineers perceive these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we are exploring the possibility of leveraging these insights to develop our own Domain Specific Language (DSL) for LM-centric computations. This DSL would allow us to experiment with LM-centric language features more freely and with greater control, moving beyond the limitations of Python and Marvin. However, for such a language to be truly effective, it must integrate or communicate with traditional languages like Python or Java, utilizing the robust existing ecosystem. Another potential avenue could involve enhancing a language like Python by introducing novel syntax that goes beyond its current structural pattern matching capabilities to include semantic pattern matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the prompting strategies for the current project is fixed. Whilst it is able to leverage tool usage to ensure schema following, it suffers from the same brittleness of manual prompt engineering. However, if we are able to parameterize the logic away from the prompting and embed the language features in a library like DSPy[5], then we could take advantage of its optimization pipeline to improve the accuracy of the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we plan to investigate the possibilities of language-aware code generation. The literature on in-coding context generation—where the LM generates code to fill in specific gaps annotated by programmers—is sparse. Current methods do not capitalize on language-specific attributes such as surrounding typing context and constraints, information that IDEs currently use to provide intellisense recommendations. We see potential for a collaborative design between IDE features and language to harness in-context analysis. Moreover, we aim to explore whether existing unit test frameworks could support code generation. While many code generation techniques currently benefit from unit tests and property-based testing, none have been fully integrated with existing unit testing frameworks. Such integration could significantly enhance the convenience and efficacy of accessing advanced code generation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Related Work\n",
    "\n",
    "This work is influenced by numerous frameworks that have aimed to simplify or enhance the interaction with LMs through programming languages. Specifically, the idea of natural language signatures is an extension of previous developments in DSP, the forerunner of today’s DSPy project[5]. Additionally, significant efforts have been made to constrain LM outputs to adhere to specific schemas or sets of constraints. Tools such as Instructor[11], Outline[12], and LangChain[13] have implemented mechanisms where LLM outputs are converted into Pydantic models, with associated constraints dynamically validated. However, unlike the Natural Language Types we propose, their validation process relies on standard Pydantic validation methods and does not systematically handle fuzzy natural language constraints or map these constraints directly to the prompts. Moreover, data not represented by the model is discarded, potentially omitting useful information in subsequent processing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a natural language contract system builds on decades of research into software contracts. The Design by Contract approach, popularized by the Eiffel programming language[14], allows programmers to annotate routines with require and ensure clauses, which are then optionally validated dynamically. The syntax we have adopted for Semantic Contracts is especially influenced by the Racket[15] contract system, notably its define/contract structure for individual functions and its ->i contract combinator for dependency among arguments and results. While Racket contracts are inherently higher-order, our design is currently first-order. Exploring the application of Semantic Contracts to a system like Racket could be an intriguing future direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, as our work primarily focuses on introducing novel programming language constructs, we see significant parallels with earlier work on programming patterns, particularly Object Relational Mappers[9], which link database tables and queries to the more familiar concepts of programming objects and functions. This pattern closely mirrors our approach of aligning LM constructs with programming language constructs. Additionally, the Natural Language Types draw from the design philosophy of Object-Oriented Design[7], arguing that the patterns of inheritance, polymorphism, and casting remain pertinent in their LM-enhanced counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this research advances the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering by developing new programming constructs designed to improve developer interactions with LLMs. We have introduced Higher Order Types and Functions, Contracts, and Semantic Pattern Matching, along with the concept of 'Natural Language Types'. These tools are designed to bridge the gap between structured programming needs and the fuzzy logic typical of LLMs, offering developers a more intuitive and effective way to utilize AI in software development. Future efforts will focus on further refining these features and assessing their practical impact through user studies. Our goal is to facilitate a more accessible and functional use of LLMs in software engineering, enhancing the overall utility and adoption of AI technologies in the development process. "
