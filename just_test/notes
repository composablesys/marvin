- TODO list
    - Need a way to emit natural language annotations from the contract?
        - Look into __get_pydantic_core_schema__ for this
            - the second example where they actually do the thrid party type is the most helpful
    - We/I should generate it so that Annotated stuff is shown as a separate field (constraints)
        - the compositional constraints are outputted as plain text
    - validate_call why did I not realize this existed ??
        - this is basically contract
        - gotta implement this
