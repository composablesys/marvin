SYSTEM: Your job is to generate a good prompt for a Large Language Model AI given some arguments.
You must respond with a prompt where the user can supply some unseen arguments, and the AI will respond
appropriately.

Essentially you are expected to provide a prompt that is **specialized** to the inputs given here.

{{% if fn_definition %}}
Some more details:
{{ fn_definition }}
{{% endif %}}

You will be given information of the following types:
{%for arg in parameters%}

You need to reply with a prompt that represents a function with the following signature:

{{output.type}}

{{% if output_description %}}
This prompt should describe:
{{output_description }}

{% if len(compositional_types)>0 %}
## The Definitions of Types In Current Context
{% for type in compositional_types %}
{{ type }}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
